### Bits and Bytes

[See Marty's slides](https://github.com/cmohge1/LAHP2019/blob/master/LAHP%202018%20Wk%204%20Working%20with%20Text.pdf).

### Command Line

Make sure you have downloaded Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

1. What are command line tools, why do we use them, and which do we use most?

- **command line tools** are based on "standard" Unix commands, but also include other commands from downloadable packages (e.g., Git and Pandoc).

- generally, **we use CLI tools** to hack our system, to have full control ...

- **the CLI tools we use most** are **navigation, conversion, and system debugging**...

- use **Tab** to complete arguments or list all available commands. 

- use **ctrl+r** to search through command history.

- **navigation:**
    - `cd`
    - `.` and `..`
    - `pwd`
    - `ls`
    - `mv`
    - `mkdir`
    - `echo`
    - `less`
    - `head`
    - `tail`
    
- **conversion**
    - `iconv`
    - `grep`
    - To locate a file by name in the current directory, `find . -iname 'NAME'`
    - `awk` (line by line processing)
    - `sed` (searching and replacing)
    
- **debugging** is important, but we won't have time to do this justice.
    
- Want to learn more? Enter `man bash` into your Terminal window.

For a very good (and broad) overview of command line tools, see https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line.


2. Exercise: Get a copy of this repository.

- Navigate to this repo (https://github.com/cmohge1/LAHP2019).

- click on the green button that says "clone or download".

- IF you have a GitHub account,
    - open your terminal, enter `cd ~/Desktop`
    - use the `git clone` function. 
    - `git clone https://github.com/cmohge1/LAHP2019.git`

- IF YOU DO NOT have a GitHub account, download the zip of the repo to your Desktop.

- in the Terminal, enter `pwd`.

- start with `cd` + ENTER.

- make a new directory called "gitspace"

- navigate to the gitspace directory, then to "LAHP2019".

- naviagte to the Billy Budd folders, and create a new folder called "diplomatic".

- move the file "ch1-leaf.xml" to "diplomatic".

- use `head` -- what do you see?

### Regular Expressions 

(AKA regex)

The best way to learn regex is to experiment with one of the online tools. But let's copy-and-paste the xml file from the Billy Budd/diplomatic directory. Then go to [Regex101](https://regex101.com/).

For more information, see this [regex cheat sheet](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285).

### Grep

See the grep basics sheet (here)[/grep-basics-sheet.pdf].

### Pandoc

Install Pandoc [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a very handy universal document converter. It is used on the command line following a basic syntax:

```pandoc FILE-TO-CONVERT -o CONVERTED-FILE```

We invoke pandoc first, then type out (and tab) the file we want to convert, use the -o option (which stands for output), and name the output file. That's it. 

Let's go back to our Terminal. Navigate to our git repo, type `ls`.

If we take this file (README.md), and we want to convert it to a PDF, how would we do that?

```pandoc README.md -o LAHP-working-textsII.pdf```

Most pandoc operations look like the above. There are more precise ways to guide the conversion: So if you want an html file of this README file,

```pandoc README.md -f markdown -t html -s -o README.html```

works like a charm, for the most part. The -f options specifies that you are converting from markdown syntax, and -t says that you are converting to html. The -s option specifies that it is a standalone file with a proper html header. In most cases, however, pandoc only needs the file extension to guide the conversion, which is why the -o option is all you need in most cases. But sometimes you do need more precision, such as with PDF conversions (note that youâ€™ll need to have LaTeX installed. See MacTeX on OS X, MiKTeX on Windows, or install the texlive package in linux).

```pandoc README.md -o README.pdf```

What happens here?

Try this instead:

```pandoc -N README.md --toc -o README.pdf```

What has changed?

I have already extolled the virtues of Markdown, and I hope you can see that you can use Pandoc to easily convert files from Markdown.
