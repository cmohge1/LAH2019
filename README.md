### Bits and Bytes

[See Marty's slides]

### Command Line

Make sure you have downloaded Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

1. What are command line tools, why do we use them, and which do we use most?

- **command line tools** are ... They are based on "standard" Unix commands, but also include other commands from downloadable packages (e.g., Git and Pandoc).

- **we use CLI tools** to hack our system, to have full control ...

- **the CLI tools we use most** are **navigation, conversion, and system debugging**... 

- **navigation:

`cd`
`pwd`
`mkdir`
`echo`


2. Exercise: Get a copy of this repository.

- start with `cd` + ENTER.

- make a new directory called "gitspace"

- navigate to the gitspace directory

- use the `git clone` function. 

`git clone https://github.com/cmohge1/LAHP2019.git`

For a very good (and broad) overview of command line tools, see https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line.

### Grep

### Regular Expressions (RegEx)

### Pandoc

Install Pandoc [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a very handy universal document converter. It is used on the command line following a basic syntax:

```pandoc FILE-TO-CONVERT -o CONVERTED-FILE```

We invoke pandoc first, then type out (and tab) the file we want to convert, use the -o option (which stands for output), and name the output file. That's it. 

Let's go back to our Terminal. Navigate to our git repo, type `ls`.

If we take this file (README.md), and we want to convert it to a PDF, how would we do that?

```pandoc README.md -o LAHP-working-textsII.pdf```

Most pandoc operations look like the above. There are more precise ways to guide the conversion: So if you want an html file of this README file,

```pandoc README.md -f markdown -t html -s -o README.html```

works like a charm, for the most part. The -f options specifies that you are converting from markdown syntax, and -t says that you are converting to html. The -s option specifies that it is a standalone file with a proper html header. In most cases, however, pandoc only needs the file extension to guide the conversion, which is why the -o option is all you need in most cases. But sometimes you do need more precision, such as with PDF conversions (note that youâ€™ll need to have LaTeX installed. See MacTeX on OS X, MiKTeX on Windows, or install the texlive package in linux).

```pandoc README.md -o README.pdf```

What happens here?

Try this instead:

```pandoc -N --template=template.tex --variable mainfont="Palatino" --variable sansfont="Helvetica" --variable monofont="Menlo" --variable fontsize=12pt --variable version=2.0 README.md --toc -o README.pdf```

What has changed?

I have already extolled the virtues of Markdown, and I hope you can see that you can use Pandoc to easily convert files from Markdown.
