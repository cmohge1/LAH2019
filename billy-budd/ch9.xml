Life in the fore-top well agreed with Billy Budd. There, when not actually engaged on the yards yet higher aloft, the topmen, who as such had been picked out for youth and activity, constitued an aerial club lounging at ease against the smaller stun&apos;sails rolled up into cushions, spinning yarns like the lazy gods, and frequently amused with what was going on in the busy world of the decks below. No wonder then that a young fellow of Billy&apos;s disposition was well content in that such society. Giving no cause of offence, to anybody, he was always alert at a call. <pb facs="89c7c328-cdee-4847-86c2-fcc759fbdb9b" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15709"/>So in the merchant service it had been with him. But now such a punctiliousness in duty was shown that his topmates would sometimes good-naturedly laugh at him for it. This heightened alacrity had its cause, namely, the impression made upon him by the first formal gangway-punishment he had ever witnessed, which befell the day following his impressment. It had been incurred by by a little fellow, young, a novice an after-guardsman absent from his assigned post when the ship was being put about; a deriliction resulting in a rather serious hitch to that manoeuvre, one demanding instantaneous promptitude in letting go and making fast. <pb facs="cebdb41f-6c0b-4a90-8a34-d6d01caa4c69" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15710"/>When Billy saw the culprit&apos;s naked back under the scourge gridironed with red welts, and worse; when he marked the dire expression in the liberated man&apos;s face as with his woolen shirt flung over him, by the executioner he rushed forward from the spot, to bury himself in the crowd, Billy was horrified. He resolved that never through remissness would he make himself liable to such a visitation or do or omit aught that might merit even verbal reproof. What then was his surprise and concern when ultimatly he found himself getting into petty trouble occasionally about such matters as the stowage of his bag or something amiss in his hammock, matters under the police <pb facs="39388106-6b6b-48b7-b720-d03a91ea48ce" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15711"/>oversight of the ship&apos;s-corporals of the lower decks, and which brought down on him a vague threat from one of them. 

</p><p>So heedful in all things as he was, how could this be? He could not understand it, and it more than vexed him. When he spoke to his young topmates about it they were either lightly incredulous or found something comical in his unconcealed anxiety. &quot;Is it your bag, Billy?&quot; said one &quot;well, sew yourself up in it, bully boy, and then you&apos;ll be sure to know if anybody meddles with it.&quot; 

</p><p>Now there was a veteran aboard who because his years began to disqualify him for more active work <pb facs="2a8d571a-52f2-4f60-8585-c23e1b9370de" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15712"/>had been recently assigned duty as main-mast-man in his watch, looking to the gear belayed at the rail roundabout that great spar near the deck. At off-times The foretopman had picked up some acquaintance with him, and now in his trouble it occurred to him that he might be the sort of person to go to for wise council. He was an old Dansker long anglicised in the service, of few words, many wrinkles and some honorable scars. His wizzened face, time-tinted and weather-stained to the complexion of an antique parchment, was here and there peppered blue by the chance explosion of a gun-cartridge in action. <pb facs="517a6140-04ea-43d7-865b-619faca2e26e" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15735"/>

</p><p>He was an Agamemnon-man; Some two years prior to the time of this story having served under Nelson when but Sir Horatio in that ship immortal in naval memory, and which dismantled and in part broken up to her bare ribs is seen a grand skeleton in Hayden&apos;s etching. As one of a boarding-party from the Agamemnon he had received a cut slantwise along one temple and cheek leaving a long pale scar like a streak of dawn&apos;s light falling athwart the dark visage. It was on account of that scar and the affair in which it was known that he had rescued it, as well as from his blue-peppered complexion that the Dansker went among the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>&apos;s crew by the name of &quot;Board-her-in- -the smoke.&quot; <pb facs="9778ee0e-eb51-4417-9b14-d667fd3f0dde" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15737"/>

</p><p>Now the first time that his small weazel-eyes happened to light on Billy Budd, a certain grim internal merriment set all his ancient wrinkles into antic play. Was it that his eccentric unsentimental old sapience primitive in its kind saw or thought it saw something which in contrast with the war-ship&apos;s environment looked oddly incongruous in the handsome sailor? But after slyly studying him at intervals, the old Merlin&apos;s equivocal merriment was modified; For now When the twain would meet, it would start in his face a quizzing sort of look, but it would be but momentary <pb facs="90045ff4-0fcd-4fc2-bcd8-095eec84052f" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15715"/>and sometimes replaced by an expression of speculative query as to what might eventually befall a nature like that, dropped into a world not without some man-traps and against whose subtleties simple courage lacking experience and address and without any touch of defensive ugliness, is of little avail; and where such innocense as man is capable of does yet in a moral emergency not always sharpen the faculties or enlighten the will. 

</p><p>However it was the Dansker in his ascetic way rather took to Billy. Nor was this only because of a certain philosophic interest in such a character. There was another cause. <pb facs="5e6bac37-452c-43bb-9ead-95ace7b9485f" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15716"/>While the old man&apos;s eccentricities, sometimes bordering on the ursine, repelled the juniors, Billy, undeterred  thereby, would make advances, revering him as a salt hero, never passing the old Agammenon-man without a salutation marked by that respect which is seldom lost on the aged however crabbed at times or whatever their station in life. <pb facs="9a9ae033-3a17-4087-a0bc-037dbce18778" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15717"/>The Dansker in fact being the originator of the by which the foretopman eventually became known aboardship.  <pb facs="df39fe23-90d6-4e01-b2b9-9860d161e9ea" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15718"/>Well then, in his mysterious little difficulty going in quest of the wrinkled one, Billy found him off duty in a dog-watch ruminating by himself seated on a shot-box of the upper gun-deck now and then surveying with a somewhat cynical regard certain of the more swaggering promenaders there. Billy recounted his trouble, again wondering how it all happened. The salt seer attentively listened, accompanying the foretopman&apos;s recital with queer twitchings of his wrinkles and problematical little sparkles of his small ferret eyes. Making an end of his story, the foretopman asked, &quot;And now, Dansker, do tell me what you think of it.&quot; <pb facs="2acddf4f-5dbd-4577-95ef-3ae18a695bd1" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15719"/>

</p><p>The old man, shoving up the front of his tarpaulin and deliberatly rubbing the long slant scar at the point where it entered the thin hair, laconically said, &quot;Baby Budd, <hi rend="italic">Jemmy Legs</hi>&quot; (meaning the master-at-arms) &quot;is down on you&quot; 

</p><p><hi rend="italic">Jimmy Legs</hi>!&quot; ejaculated Billy his welkin eyes expanding; &quot;what for?  Why he calls me <hi rend="italic">the sweet and pleasant young fellow</hi>, they tell me.&quot;  

</p><p>&quot;Does he so?&quot; grinned the grizzled one; then said Ay Baby, lad &quot;A sweet voice has <hi rend="italic">Jimmy Legs</hi>&quot; <pb facs="2fd2f7f5-84aa-42d6-8fda-941b368347f2" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15720"/>

</p><p>&quot;No, not always. But to me he has. I seldom pass him but there comes a pleasant word.&quot;  

</p><p>&quot;And that&apos;s because he&apos;s down upon you, Baby Budd.&quot;

</p><p>Such reiteration along with the manner of it, incomprehensible to a novice, disturbed Billy almost as much as the mystery for which he had sought explanation. Something less unpleasingly oracular he tried to extract; but the old sea-Chiron thinking perhaps that for the nonce he had <pb facs="1b6e4e94-1432-45b9-a461-69e2dcc32aa7" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15753"/>sufficiently instructed his young Achilles, pursed his lips, gathered all his wrinkles together and would commit himself to nothing further. Years, and those experiences which befall certain shrewder men subordinated life-long to the will of superiors, all this  had developed in the Dansker the pithy guarded cynicism that was his leading characteristic. </p></body>
