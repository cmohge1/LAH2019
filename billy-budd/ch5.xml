Yes, The outbreak at the Nore was put down. But not every grievance was redressed. If the contractors, for example, were no longer permitted to ply some practices peculiar to their tribe everywhere, such as providing shoddy cloth, rations not sound, or false in the measure; not the less impressment, for one thing, went on. By custom sanctioned for centuries, and judicially maintained by a Lord Chancellor as late as Mansfield, that mode of manning the fleet, a mode now fallen into a sort of abeyance but never formally renounced, it was not practicable to give up in those years. <pb facs="8cfb7080-f363-43f1-87e5-a65827171558" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15579"/>Its abrogation would have crippled the indispensable fleet, one wholly under canvas, no steam-power, its innumerable sails and thousands of cannon, everything in short, worked by muscle alone; a fleet the more insatiate in demand for men, because then multiplying its ship of all grades against contingencies present and to come of the convulsed Continent. <pb facs="fc587186-6e2a-4d98-9993-aa88c0731b64" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15580"/>

One instance of such apprehensions: In the same year with this story, Nelson, then Vice Admiral Sir Horatio, being with the fleet off the Spanish coast, was directed by the Admiral in command to shift his pennant from the <hi rend="italic">Captain</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Theseus</hi>; and for this reason: that the latter ship having newly <pb facs="f7229f28-00f7-406e-9593-b780a0023039" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15581"/> arrived on the station from home where it had taken part in the Great Mutiny, danger was apprehended from the temper <pb facs="71a748b5-b5a3-4232-b54c-ac3817290877" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15582"/>of the men; and it was thought that an officer like Nelson was the one, not indeed to terrorize the crew into base subjection, but to win them, by force of his mere prescence and heroic personality back to an allegiance if not as enthusiastic yet as true.

</p><p>So it was that for a time, on more than one quarter-deck anxiety did exist. At sea precautionary vigilance was strained against relapse. At short notice an engagement might come on. When it did, in some instances the lieutenants assigned to batteries felt it incumbent on them, in some instances to stand with drawn swords behind the men working the guns.</p></body>
