Though our new-made foretopman was well recieved in the top and on the gun-decks, hardly here was he that cynosure he had previously been among those minor ship&apos;s companies of the merchant marine, with which companies only had he hitherto consorted. 

</p><p>He was young; and despite his all but fully developed frame in aspect looked even younger than he really was, oweing to a lingering adolescent expression in the as yet  smooth face all but feminine in purity of natural complexion <pb facs="df928fa1-15a4-4773-a58c-455be5eaac8b" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15458"/>but where, thanks to his seagoing, the lily was quite suppressed and the rose had some ado visably to flush through the tan. 

</p><p>To one essentially such a novice in the complexities of factitious life, the abrupt transition from his former and simpler sphere to the ampler and more knowing world of a great war-ship; this might well have abashed him had there been any conciet or vanity in his composition. Among her miscellanious multitude, the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi> mustered <pb facs="a45ac44b-45ad-4b1b-a0d9-7d6d64b555e2" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15459"/>several individuals who however inferior in grade were of no common natural stamp, sailors more signally susceptive of that air which continuous martial discipline and repeated prescence in battle can in some degree impart even to the average man. As the handsome sailor Billy Budd&apos;s position aboard the seventy-four was something analagous to that of a rustic beauty transplanted from the provinces and brought into competition with the high born dames of the court. <pb facs="519eb116-7d19-40f9-b716-e11a7f4cc32c" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15460"/>But this change of circumstances he scarce noted. As little did he observe that something about him provoked an ambiguous  smile in one or two harder faces among the blue-jackets. Nor less unaware was he of the peculiar favorable effect his person and demeanor had upon the more intelligent gentleman of the quarter-deck. Nor could this well have been otherwise. <pb facs="7b2326a0-c0c7-438f-8062-39c50381ed2a" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15498"/>Cast in a mould peculiar to the finest physical examples of those Englishmen  in whom the Saxon strain would seem not at all to partake of any Norman or other admixture, he showed in  face that humane look of reposeful good nature which the Greek sculptor in some instances gave to his heroic strong man, Hercules. But this again was subtly modified by another and pervasive quality. The ear, small and shapely, the arch of the foot, the curve in mouth and nostril, even the indurated hand dyed to the orange-tawny of the toucan&apos;s bill, a hand telling alike of the halyards <pb facs="d1167400-df10-4513-a10a-5591413fc336" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15462"/>and tar-bucket; but, above all, something in the mobile expression, and every chance attitude and movement, something suggestive of a mother eminently favored by Love and the  Graces; all this strangely indicated a lineage in direct contradiction to his lot. The mysteriousness here, became less mysterious through a matter-of-fact elicited when Billy at the capstan was  being formally mustered into the service. Asked by the officer, a small brisk little gentleman as it chanced among  other questions, his place of birth, he  replyed, &quot;Please, Sir, I do&apos;nt know.&quot;  

</p><p>&quot;Do&apos;nt know where you were born?—Who was your father? <pb facs="42543a88-449d-468d-99eb-3f490830bb6e" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15465"/><pb facs="ed2f8f89-56e0-4e17-9565-602ba8d48aef" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15500"/>
&quot;God knows, Sir.&quot; 

</p><p>Struck by the straightforward simplicity of these replies, the officer next asked &quot;Do you know anything about your beginning?&quot;

</p><p>&quot;No, Sir. But I have heard that I was found in a pretty silk-lined basket hanging one morning from the knocker of a good man&apos;s door in Bristol&quot; <pb facs="4448cb15-5fcf-4495-884c-dea4a9b5d311" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15502"/>

</p><p>&quot;Found say you? Well,&quot; throwing back his head and looking up and down the new recruit; &quot;Well it turns out to have been a pretty good find. Hope they&apos;ll find some more like you, my man; the fleet sadly needs them.&quot; 

</p><p>Yes, Billy Budd was a foundling, a presumable bye-blow, and, evidently, no ignoble one. Noble descent was as evident in him as in a blood horse. 

</p><p>For the rest, with little or no sharpness of faculty or any trace of the wisdom of the serpent, nor yet <pb facs="6e099954-2f8d-4143-80cc-2cff6bea3dc1" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15466"/>quite a dove, he possessed that kind and degree of intelligence going along with the unconventional rectitude of a sound human creature, one to whom not yet has been proffered the questionable apple of knowledge. He was illiterate; he could not read, but he could sing, and like the illiterate nightingale was sometimes the composer of his own song. 

</p><p>Of self-consciousness he seemed to have little or none, or about as much as we may reasonably impute to a dog of Saint Bernard&apos;s breed <pb facs="0733e75c-62f6-496b-85a0-ae8170be34e6" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15508"/>

</p><p>Habitually living with the elements and knowing little more of the land than as a beach, or, rather, that portion of the terraqueous globe providentially set apart for dance-houses doxies and tapsters, in short what sailors call a &quot;fidlers&apos; green,&quot; his simple nature remained unsophisticated by those moral obliquties which are not in every case incompatable with that manufacturable thing known as respectability. But are sailors, frequenters of &quot;fiddlers&apos;-greens,&quot; without vices? No; but less often than with landsmen do their vices, so called, partake of crookedness of heart, seeming <pb facs="4143b5e9-2a5a-42a8-8972-d17116d4bedc" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15510"/>less to proceed from viciousness than exuberance of vitality after  long constraint: frank manifestations in accordance with natural law. By his original constitution aided by the cooperating influnces of his lot, Billy in many respects was little more than a sort of upright barbarian, much such perhaps as Adam presumably might have been ere the urbane Serpent   wriggled himself into his company. 

</p><p>And here be it submitted that apparently going to corroborate the doctrine of man&apos;s fall, a doctrine now popularly ignored,it is observable that where certain virtues pristine and unadulterate <pb facs="906fb437-7fad-48be-8502-8d45ba465988" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15469"/><pb facs="883058b8-fb07-4973-8ff7-d6c3084d5b8e" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15480"/>peculiarly characterize anybody in the external uniform of civilization, they will upon scrutiny seem not to be  derived from custom or convention, but rather to be out of keeping with  these, as if indeed exceptionally transmitted from a period prior to Cain&apos;s city and  citified man. The character marked  by such qualities has to an unvitiated taste an untampered-with flavor like  that of berries, while the man thoroughly civilized even in a fair specimen of the breed has to the same moral pallet a questionable smack as of a compounded wine. To any stray inheritor of of these primitive qualities found, like Caspar Hauser, wandering dazed in any Christian capital of our time <pb facs="5aa8c64d-a43c-471f-8cd4-2777567a860e" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15471"/>the good-natured poet&apos;s famous invocation, near two  thousand years ago, of the good rustic out of his latitude in the Rome,   of the Cesars still appropriately holds:—Honest and poor, 

</p><p>&quot;Faithful in word and thought 
What has thee, Fabian, to the city brought.&quot; 

</p><p>Though our Handsome Sailor had as much of masculine beauty as one can expect anywhere to see; nevertheless, like the beautiful woman in one of Hawthorne&apos;s minor tales, there was just one thing amiss in him. No   visible blemish indeed, as with the lady; no, but an occasional liability to a vocal defect. Though in the hour <pb facs="807c66b4-dc93-433a-b596-b14ac8fbe1a4" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15472"/>of elemental uproar or peril, he was everything that a sailor should be, yet under sudden provocation of  strong heart-feeling his voice otherwise singularly musical, as if expressive of the harmony within, was apt to develop an organic hesitancy, in fact more or less of a stutter or even worse <pb facs="2096dd2b-5e37-4213-a957-5301b5a4c114" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15473"/><pb facs="abe4046e-c907-4d4a-9b2e-e4d620cce3f4" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15488"/>In this particular Billy was a striking instance that the arch interferer, the envious marplot of Eden still has more or less  to do with every human consignment to this planet of earth. In every case, one way or another he is sure to slip in his little card, as much as to remind us—I too have a hand here. 

</p><p>The avowal of such an imperfection in the Handsome Sailor should be evidence not alone that he is not presented as a conventional hero, but also that the story in which he is the  main figure is no romance.</p></body>
