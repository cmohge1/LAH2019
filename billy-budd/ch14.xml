Not many days after the last incident narrated something befell Billy Budd that more gravelled him that aught that had previously occurred. 

</p><p>It was a warm night for the latitude; and the Foretopman, whose watch at the time was properly below, was, dozing on the uppermost deck whither he had ascended from his hot hammock one of hundreds suspended so closely wedged together over a lower gun-deck that there was little or no swing to them. He lay as in the shadow of a hill-side stretched under the lee of the <hi rend="italic">booms</hi>, <pb facs="0836af2f-df66-4360-a215-016917fe0fa7" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15920"/>a piled ridge amidships of spare spars between foremast &amp; mainmast and among which the ship&apos;s largest boat, the launch, was stowed. , Alongside of three other slumberers from below, he lay near that end of the booms&apos; which approaches from the foremast; his station aloft on duty as a foretopman being just over the deck-station of the forecastlemen, entitling him according to usage to make himself more or less at home in that neighborhood. <pb facs="ee1e6737-676e-4bf1-8c52-4736acd6f9a5" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15936"/>

</p><p>Presently he was stirred into semi-consciousness by sombody, who must have previously sounded the sleep of the others, touching his shoulder, and then as the Foretopman raised his head, breathing into his ear  in a quick whisper, &quot;Slip into the lee  fore-chains, Billy; there is something in the wind. D&apos;ont speak. Quick, I will meet you there&quot;; and disappeared. 

</p><p>Now Billy like sundry other essentially goodnatured ones had some of the weaknesses inseparable from essential good nature; and among these was a reluctance, almost an incapacity of plumply saying no to an abrupt proposition not absurd, nor on the face of it, nor obviously unfriendly, nor iniquitous. And being of warm blood, he had not the phlegm to tacitly to negative any proposition by unresponsive inaction. <pb facs="a6ca3e10-4dce-40ae-9a21-a5a146050496" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15940"/>Like his sense of fear, his apprehension as to aught outside of the honest &amp; natural was seldom very quick. Besides, upon the present occasion, the drouse from his sleep still hung upon him. 

</p><p>However it was, he mechanically rose, and sleepily wondering what could be in the wind, betook himself to the designated place, a narrow platform, one of six, outside of the high bulwarks and screened by the great dead-eyes and multiple columned lanyards of the shrouds and back-stays; and, in a great war-ship of that time, of dimensions commensurate hull&apos;s magnitude; a tarry balcony in short overhanging the sea, and so secluded that one mariner <pb facs="d8710ca3-8b73-4c25-8d24-f9af6a9c9d75" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15904"/>of the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>, a non-conformist old tar of a serious turn, made it even in daytime his private oratory. 

</p><p>In this retired nook the stranger soon joined Billy Budd. There was no moon as yet; a haze obscured the star-light. He could not distinctly see the stranger&apos;s face. Yet from something in the outline and carriage, Billy took him to be, and correctly, for one of the afterguard. 

</p><p>&quot;Hist! Billy,&quot; said the man; in the same quick cautionary whisper as before &quot;You were impressed, were&apos;t you? Well, so was I;&quot; and he paused, as to mark the effect. But Billy not knowing exactly what to make of this <pb facs="8c3e74b5-8b50-4b09-9b11-d34a9878d566" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15926"/>said nothing. Then the other: &quot;We are not the only impressed ones, Billy. There&apos;s a gang of us.—Could&apos;nt you—help—at a pinch? 

</p><p>&quot;What do you mean? demanded Billy here shaking off his his drouse. 

</p><p>&quot;Hist, hist! the hurried whisper now growing husky, see here;&quot; and the man held up two small objects faintly twinkling in the nightlight; &quot;see, they are yours, Billy, if you&apos;ll only—&quot; 

</p><p>But Billy broke in, and in his resentful eagerness to deliver himself his vocal infirmity somewhat intruded; &quot;D-D Damme, I do&apos;nt know what you are d-d-driving <pb facs="2e1040bd-fff1-48f3-b171-7a0dbdc98083" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15912"/>at, or what you mean, but you had better g-g-go where you belong!&quot; For the moment the fellow, as confounded, did not stir; and Billy springing to his feet, said &quot;If you d-dont start, I&apos;ll t-t-toss you back over the r-rail!&quot; There was no mistaking this and the mysterious emissary decamped disappearing in the direction of the mainmast in the shadow of the booms. 

</p><p>&quot;Hallo, what&apos;s the matter?&quot; here came growling from a forecastleman awakened from his deck-doze by Billy&apos;s raised voice. And as the foretopman reappeared and was recognized by him; &quot;Ah, <hi rend="italic">Beauty</hi>, <pb facs="81b9da0c-e422-4803-9f15-d9de0fb3ba34" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15930"/>is it you? Well, something must have been the matter for you st-st-stuttered.&quot; 

</p><p>&quot;O,&quot; rejoined Billy, now mastering the impediment; &quot;I found an afterguardsman in our part of the ship here and I bid him be off where he belongs.&quot;  

</p><p>&quot;And is that all you did about it, foretopman?&quot; gruffly demanded another, an irascable irasciableHS old fellow of brick-colored visage and hair, and who was known to his associate forecastlemen as <hi rend="italic">Red Pepper</hi>; &quot;Such sneaks I should like to marry to the gunner&apos;s daughter!&quot; by that expression meaning that he would like to subject them to disciplinary castigation over a gun. <pb facs="fda080dc-0bab-4dd6-87ea-91bf2e756248" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15908"/>

</p><p>However, the Billy&apos;s rendering of the matter satisfactorily accounted to these inquirers for the brief commotion, since of all the sections of a ship&apos;s company the forecastlemen, veterans for the most part and bigoted in their sea-prejudices, are the most jealous in resenting territorial encroachments, especially on the part of any of the afterguard, of whom they have but a sorry opinion, chiefly landsmen, never going aloft except to reef or furl the mainsail, and in no wise competent to handle a marlinspike or turning in a dead-eye, say.</p></body>
