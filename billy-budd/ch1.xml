In the time before steamships, or then more frequently than now, a stroller along the docks of any considerable sea-port would occasionally have his attention arrested by a group of bronzed mariners, man-of-war&apos;s men or merchant-sailors in holiday attire ashore on liberty. In certain instances they would flank, or, like a body-guard quite surround some superior figure of their own class<pb facs="2e792fdd-5f80-49fa-a26d-94e8ba36ae57" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16901"/>, moving along with them like Aldebaran among the lesser lights of his constellation. That signal object was the &quot;Handsome Sailor&quot; of the less prosaic time alike of the military and merchant navies. With no perceptible trace of the vainglorious about him, rather with the off-hand unaffectedness of natural regality, he seemed to accept the spontaneous homage of his shipmates. <pb facs="97d8170d-d3bc-4ff6-8356-d22dd26e9628" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16902"/>

</p><p>A somewhat remarkable instance recurs to me. In Liverpool, now  half a century ago I saw under the shadow of the great dingy  street-wall of Prince&apos;s Dock <pb facs="c98f31b3-0ca0-4362-8332-92f2c06a538a" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16903"/>(an obstruction long since removed) a common sailor, so intensely black that he must needs have been a native African of the unadulterate blood of Ham. A symmetric figure much above the  average height. The two ends of a gay silk handerchief thrown loose about the neck danced upon the displayed ebony of his chest; in his ears were big hoops of gold, and a Highland Scotch bonnet with a tartan band set off his shapely head. It was a hot noon in July; and his face, lustrius with perspiration, beamed with barbaric good humor. <pb facs="93431b29-d5c6-4d4d-b4d5-c67be071ddfc" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16904"/>In jovial sallies right and left his white teeth flashing into view  he rollicked along, the centre  of a company of his shipmates. These were made up of such an assortment of tribes and complexions as would have well fitted them to be marched up by Anacharsis Cloots before the bar of the first French Assembly  as Representatives of the Human Race. At each spontaneous tribute rendered by the wayfarers to this black  pagod of a fellow—the tribute of a pause and stare, and less  frequent an exclamation,—the motley retinue showed that they took that <pb facs="ba6906a7-afe1-401b-83bb-346dcd7f5a2e" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16905"/>sort of pride in which the evoker of it the Assryian priests doubtless showed for their grand sculptured Bull when the faithful prostrated themselves. <pb facs="8b398d4a-e594-4b1e-9df1-6a42e3e80d58" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16906"/>

</p><p>To return. If in some cases a bit of a nautical Murat in setting forth his person ashore, the handsome sailor of the period in question evinced nothing of the dandified Billy-be-Dam, an amusing character all but extinct now, but occasionally to be encountered, and in a form yet more amusing than the original, at the tiller of the boats on the tempestuous Erie Canal or, more likely, vaporing in the groggeries along the tow-path. <pb facs="c2f5bc0a-f949-46c1-b568-db4b065fc6d1" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16907"/>

</p><p>Invariably a proficient in his perilous calling, he was also more or less of a  mighty boxer or wrestler. It was strength and beauty. Tales of his prowess were recited. Ashore he was the champion; afloat the spokesman; on every suitable occasion always foremost. Close-reefing topsails in a gale, there he was, astride the weather yard-arm-end, foot the Flemish horse as in &quot;stirrup,&quot; both hands tugging at the &quot;ear-ring&quot; as at a bridle, in verry much the attitude of young Alexander curbing the  fiery Bucephalus. A superb figure, tossed up as by the horns of Taurus against the thunderous <pb facs="f01b4487-c660-45dc-bd22-f7984115a6e0" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16908"/>sky, cheerily hallooing to the strenuous file along the spar.  The moral nature was seldom out of keeping with the physical make. Indeed, except  as toned by the former, the comeliness  and power, always attractive in masculine conjunction, hardly could have drawn the sort of honest homage the Handsome Sailor in some examples received from his less gifted associates.<pb facs="a2718fa6-c5e6-4bec-941d-f7c2cd4aff8c" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16909"/>

</p><p>Such a cynosure, at least in aspect, and something such too in   nature, though with important variations made apparent as the story proceds, was welkin-eyed Billy Budd, or Baby Budd as more  familiarly under circumstances hereafter to be given he at last came to be calld aged twenty-one, a foretopman of the British fleet toward the close of the last decade of the eighteenth century. It was not very long prior to the time of the  narration that follows that he had entered the King&apos;s service, having been impressed on the Narrow Seas <pb facs="9dd2d6cc-8fa1-49d5-8924-809406329c35" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16910"/>from a homeward-bound English merchantman into a seventy-four  outward-bound, H. M. S. <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>; which ship, as was not unusual in those hurried days having been obliged to put to sea short of her proper complement of men. Plump upon Billy at first sight in the gangway the boarding officer Lieutenant Ratcliffe pounced, even before the merchantman&apos;s crew was formally mustered on the quarter-deck for his deliberate inspection. And Him only he elected. For whether it was because the other men when ranged before him showed to <pb facs="e9317699-d1ba-41f9-a48e-0c06a5b2f79d" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16911"/>ill advantage after Billy, or whether he had some scruples in view of the  merchantman being rather short-handed, however it might be, the officer contented himself with his first spontaneous choice. To the surprize surprise of the ship&apos;s company, though much to the Lieutenant&apos;s satisfaction Billy made no demur. But, indeed, any demur would have been as idle as the  protest of a goldfinch popped into a cage.<pb facs="202bbed2-d541-485c-8a0a-5cb76e3983ff" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16912"/>

</p><p>Noting this uncomplaining acquiesence, all but cheerful one might  say, the shipmaster turned a surprized glance of silent reproach at the sailor. The shipmaster was one of those worthy  mortals found in every vocation even the humbler ones—the sort of person whom everybody agrees in calling &quot;a respectable man.&quot; And—nor so strange to report as it may appear to be—though a ploughman of the troubled waters, life-long contending with the intractable elements, there was nothing this honest soul <pb facs="e7eedd34-8279-49ad-b111-69ddff3ab847" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16913"/>at heart loved better than simple peace and quiet. For the rest, he was fifty or thereabouts, a little inclined to corpulence, a prepossessing face, unwhiskered, and of an agreeable color—a rather full face, humanely intelligent in expression. On a fair day with a fair wind and all going well, a certain musical chime in his voice seemed to be the veritable unobstructed outcome of the inner most man. He had much prudence, much conscientiousness, and there were occasions when these virtues were the cause of overmuch disquietude in him.  <pb facs="0675673d-b93d-4c13-95b9-a9d94c4a2b1f" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16914"/>On a passage, so long as his craft was in any proximity to land, no sleep for Captain Graveling. He took to heart those serious responsibilities not so heavily borne by some shipmasters. 

</p><p>Now while Billy Budd was down in the forecastle getting his kit together, the <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi></hi></hi></hi></hi></hi></hi></hi></hi></hi></hi>&apos;s lieutenant, burly and bluff, nowise disconcerted by Captain Graveling&apos;s omitting to profer the customary hospitalities on an occasion so unwelcome to him, an omission simply caused by preoccupation of thought, unceremoniously invited himself into the cabin, and also to a flask from the spirit-locker, <pb facs="e027587b-e852-4221-ac63-149385749d63" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16915"/>a receptacle which his experiend eye instantly discovered. In fact he was one  of those sea-dogs in whom all the hardship and peril of naval life in the great prolonged wars of his time never impaired the natural instinct for sensuous enjoyment. His  duty he always faithfully did; but duty is sometimes a dry obligation, and he was for irrigating its aridity whensoever possible, with a fertilizing decoction of strong waters. For the cabin&apos;s proprietor there was nothing left but to play the part of the inforced host with whatever grace and alacrity were practicable. <pb facs="1c6e55c2-4f70-40ee-ba18-652a494fd2e1" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;"/><pb facs="ad6ad74c-135d-4ceb-abd6-692b83b2c067" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16916"/>As necessary adjuncts to the flask, he silently placed tumbler and water-jug  before the irrepressable guest. But excusing himself from partaking just then, dismally watched the  unembarrassed officer deliberatly diluting his grog a little, then tossing it off in three swallows, pushing the empty tumbler away, yet not so far as to be beyond easy reach, at  the same settling himself in his seat and smacking his lips with high satisfaction, looking straight at the host.

</p><p>These proceedings over, the Master broke the silence; <pb facs="b4dea37c-fb66-4d57-a0cb-286daa920da5" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16917"/>and there lurked a rueful reproach in the tone of his voice: &quot;Lieutenant, you are going to take my best man  from me, the jewel of &apos;em.&quot;

</p><p>&quot;Yes, I know&quot; rejoined the other, immediatly drawing back the tumbler <pb facs="2bbf03af-34b7-4dff-91cd-9dd7259630ea" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16918"/>preliminary to a replenishing; &quot;Yes;  I know. Sorry&quot;

</p><p>&quot;Beg pardon, but you do&apos;nt understand, Lieutenant. See here now. Before I shipped that young fellow, my forecastle was a rat-pit of quarrels. It was black times, I tell you, aboard the &quot;<hi rend="italic">Rights</hi>&quot; here. I was worried to that degree my pipe had no comfort for me. But Billy came; and it was like a Catholic priest striking peace in an Irish shindy. Not that he preached to them or said or did anything in particular; but a virtue went out of him, sugaring  the sour ones. They took to him like  hornets to treacle; all but the buffer <pb facs="b19e43d9-a77a-4275-a7b5-7370296ed69e" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16919"/>of the gang, the big shaggy chap with the fire-red whiskers. He  indeed out of envy, perhaps, of the new-comer, and thinking such a &quot;sweet and pleasant fellow,&quot; as he mockingly designated him to the others, could hardly have the spirit of a game-cock, must needs bestir himself in trying to get up an ugly row with him. <pb facs="887ddc6a-a99b-4a76-ba54-38ff42699a8d" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16920"/>Billy forebore with him and reasoned with him in a pleasant way—&quot;he is something like myself, lieutenant, to whom aught like a quarrel is hateful&quot;—but nothing served. So, in the second dog-watch one day the Red Whiskers in prescence of the others, under pretence of showing Billy just whence a sirloin steak was cut—for the fellow had once been a butcher—insultingly gave him a dig under the ribs. Quick as lightning Billy let fly his arm. I dare say he never meant to do quite as much as he did, but any how he gave the burly fool a terrible drubbing. <pb facs="f6c93a6b-545c-4813-adcb-1ec9198f56d1" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16921"/>It took about half a minute, I should think. And, lord bless you, the lubber was astonished at the celerity. And will you believe it, Lieutenant, the Red Whiskers now really loves  Billy—loves him, or is the biggest hypocrite that ever I heard of. But they all love him. <pb facs="e042390c-22fd-4029-a656-0d0ed95cfa83" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17627"/>Some of &apos;em do his washing, darn his old trowsers for him; the carpenter is at odd times making a pretty little chest of drawers for him. Anybody will do any thing for Billy Budd; and it&apos;s the happy family here. But Now, Lieutenant<ref target="#ref_28556">,</ref><note xml:id="ref_28556">Lieutenant,] Lieutenant [MS]  // MEL adds the necessary comma to complete the apposition.</note> if that young fellow goes—I know how it will be aboard the &quot;<hi rend="italic">Rights</hi>.&quot; Not again very soon, shall I, coming up from dinner, lean over the capstain smoking a quiet pipe—no, not very soon again, I think. Ay, Lieutenant, you are going to take away the jewel of &apos;em;  you are going to take away my peacemaker! &quot;And with that the good soul had really some ado in checking a rising sob.<pb facs="33f03d3e-2061-4a5a-8b1f-af582becb60d" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15440"/>

</p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the lieutenant who had listened with amused  interest to all this, and now waxing merry with his tipple; &quot;Well, blessed are the peacemakers especially the fighting peacemakers.! And such are the seventy-four beauties some of which you see poking their noses out of the port-holes of yonder war-ship lying-to for me&quot; pointing thro&apos; the cabin window at the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>. But courage! do&apos;nt look so  downhearted, man. Why, I pledge you in advance the royal  approbation. Rest assured that His Majesty will be delighted<pb facs="ad30416f-d45b-4bd5-8068-e13380f3af62" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16922"/>to learn that in a time when his hard tack is not sought for by sailors with such avidity as should be; a time also when some  shipmasters privily resent the borrowing from them a tar or two for the service; His Magesty, I say, will be delighted to learn that one shipmaster at least cheerfully surrenders to the King, the flower of his flock, a sailor who with equal loyalty makes no dissent.—But where&apos;s my beauty? Ah,&quot; looking through the cabin&apos;s open door <pb facs="0118076c-106b-450d-837f-a2cd8878c513" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15442"/>&quot;Here he comes; and, by Jove—lugging along his chest—Apollo with his portmanteau!—My man,&quot; stepping out to him, &quot;You can&apos;t take that big box aboard a war-ship. The boxes there are mostly  shot-boxes. Put your duds in a bag, lad. Boot and saddle for the cavalryman bag and hammock for the man-of war&apos;s-man.&quot; 

</p><p>The transfer from chest to bag was made. And, after seeing his man into the cutter and then following him down, the lieutenant <pb facs="e66d6f3b-3947-4eeb-96d6-f64df1db2a14" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;"/><pb facs="7606a42e-b29d-4004-a94f-dc58ff0d9fd0" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16923"/>pushed off from the <hi rend="italic">Rights-of-Man</hi>. That was the merchant-ship&apos;s name; tho&apos; by her master and crew abbreviated in sailor fashion into <hi rend="italic">The Rights</hi>. The hard-headed Dundee owner was a staunch admirer of Thomas Paine whose book in rejoinder to Burke&apos;s arraignment of the French Revolution had then been published  for some time and had gone everywhere. In christening his vessel after the  title of Paine&apos;s volume the man of Dundee  was something like his contemporary shipowner, Stephen Girard of Philadelphia, whose sympathies, alike with his native land and its liberal philosophers, he evinced by naming his ships after Voltaire, Diderot, and so forth.<pb facs="d03d88c0-1082-4d62-800f-a58e2d598ce6" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15444"/>

</p><p>But now , when the boat swept under the merchant-man&apos;s stern, and officer and oarsmen, were noting—some bitterly and others  with a grin,—the name emblazoned there; just then it was that  <pb facs="e6c461b4-3614-4018-ae5d-2ee0172215b2" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16925"/>the new recruit jumped up from the bow where the coxswain had directed him to sit, and waving hat to his silent shipmates sorrowfully looking over at him from the  taffrail, bade the lads a genial good-bye, then, making a salutation as to the ship herself, &quot;and good bye to you too, old <hi rend="italic">Rights of Man</hi>.&quot;  

</p><p>&quot;Down, Sir!&quot; roared the lieutenant, instantly assuming all the rigor of his rank, though with difficulty repressing a smile.<pb facs="a52fd7e4-896d-49d5-9af2-c89351b468af" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15446"/>

</p><p>To be sure Billy&apos;s action was a terrible breach of naval decorum. But in that decorum he had never been instructed; in consideration of which the lieutenant would hardly have been so energetic in reproof but for the concluding farewell to the ship. This he rather took as meant to convey a covert sally on the new recruit&apos;s part, a sly slur at impressment in general, and that of himself in especial. And yet, more likely, if satire it was in effect, it was hardly so by intention, for Billy tho&apos; happily endowed with the gayety of high health, youth, and a free heart, was yet by no means of a satirical turn. The will to it and the sinister dexterity were alike wanting. To deal in double meanings and insinuations of  any sort was quite foreign to his nature.<pb facs="e529cc3f-547d-4478-a99b-3e9ca6652302" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15447"/>

</p><p>As to his enforced enlistment, that he  seemed to take pretty much as he was wont to take any vicissitude of weather. Like the animals, though no philosopher, he was, without knowing   it, practically a fatalist. And, it may be, that he rather liked this adventurous turn in his affairs, which promised an  opening into novel scenes and martial excitements. 

</p><p>Aboard the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi> our merchant-sailor was forthwith rated as an able-seaman and assigned to the starboard watch of the fore-top. <pb facs="ef060f53-d74d-4ec7-88c2-faafee500646" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15448"/>He was soon at home in the service, not at all disliked for his unpretentious good looks and a sort of genial happy-go-lucky  air. No merrier man in his mess: in marked contrast to certain other individuals included like himself among the impressed portion of the ship&apos;s company; for these when not activly employed were sometimes, and more particularly in the last dog-watch when the drawing near of twilight induced revery, apt to fall into a saddish mood which in some partook of sullenness. But they were not so young as our foretopman, and no few of them must <pb facs="72604b0e-a1e3-4ff8-a929-00b5ac039910" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;15449"/>have known a hearth of some sort, others may have had wives and children  left, too probably, in uncertain circumstances, and hardly any but must have had acknowledged kith and kin, while  for Billy, as will shortly be seen, his entire family was practically {confined} invested in himself.  </p></body>
