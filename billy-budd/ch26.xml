A digression. 

</p><p>When some days afterwards in reference to the singularity just mentioned, the Purser a rather ruddy rotund person more accurate as an accountant than profound as a philosopher, said at mess to the Surgeon, &quot;What testimony to the force lodged in will-power&quot; the latter saturnine spare and tall, one in whom a discreet causticity went along with a mannerless genial than polite, replied, &quot;Your pardon, Mr. Purser. In a hanging scientifically conducted—and under special orders I myself directed how Budd&apos;s was to be effected—any movement following the completed suspension and originating in the body suspended, such movement indicates <pb facs="f397744d-d437-4778-9055-7b7c350cdd86" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17634"/>mechanical spasm in the muscular system. Hence the abscence of that is no more attributable to will-power as you call it than to horse-power—beggging your pardon.&quot; 

</p><p>&quot;But this muscular spasm you speak of, is not that in a degree more or less invariable in these cases?&quot; 

</p><p>&quot;Assuredly so, Mr. Purser.&quot;  

</p><p>&quot;How then, my good sir, do you account for its absence in this instance? 

</p><p>&quot;Mr. Purser, it is clear that your sense of the singularity in this matter equals not mine. You account for it by what you call will-power a term not yet included in the lexicon of science. For me I do not, <pb facs="cd62afad-ab91-4279-ac04-2e7c17dc8ff3" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17636"/>with my personal knowledge pretend to account for it at all. Even should one assume the hypothesis that at the first touch of the halyards the action of Budd&apos;s heart intensified by extraordinary emotion at its climax, abruptly stopt—much like a watch when in carelessly winding it up you strain at the finish, thus snapping the chain—even under that hypothesis how acount for the phenomenon that followed.&quot;  

</p><p>&quot;You admit then that the absence of spasmodic movement was  phenominal.&quot;  

</p><p>It was phenominal, Mr. Purser, in the sense that it was an appearance <pb facs="b321064c-9ec9-47fd-b502-07fbe749872b" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17638"/>the cause of which is not immediatly to be assigned.&quot;  

</p><p>But tell me, my dear Sir, pertinaciously continued the other, &quot;was the man&apos;s death effected by the halter, or was it a species of euthanasia?  

</p><p>&quot;<hi rend="italic">Euthanasia</hi>, Mr. Purser, is something like your <hi rend="italic">will-power</hi>: I doubt its authenticity as a scientific term—begging your pardon again. It is at once imaginative and metaphysical—in short, Greek. But,&quot; abruptly changing his tone &quot;There is a case in the sick-bay that I do not care to leave to my assistants. Beg your pardon, but excuse me.&quot; And rising from the mess he formally withdrew.</p></body>
