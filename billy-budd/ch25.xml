The night so luminous on the spar-deck but otherwise on the cavernous ones below, levels so like the tiered galleries in a coal-mine–the luminous night passed away. But, like the prophet in the chariot disappearing in heaven and dropping his mantle to Elisha, the withdrawing night transferred its pale robe to the breaking day. A meek shy light appeared in the East where stretched a diaphonous fleece of white furrowed vapor.<pb facs="55d53ebf-d612-4480-afa5-a58490078672" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17726"/>That light slowly waxed. Suddenly <hi rend="italic">eight bells</hi> were struck aft, responded to by one louder metallic stroke from forward. It was four o&apos;clock in the morning. Instantly the silver whistles were heard summoning all hands to witness punishment, up through the great hatchways rimmed with racks of heavy shot, the watch below came pouring overspreading with the watch already on deck the space between the mainmast and foremast including that occupied by the capacious launch and the black booms tiered on either side of it, boat and booms making a summit of observation for the powder-boys and younger tars. <pb facs="dde040bb-e3f2-4099-9a77-f62c1cb53c88" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17740"/>A different group comprising one watch of topmen leaned over the rail of that sea-balcony, no small one in a seventy-four, looking down on the crowd below. Man or boy none spake but in whisper, and few spake at all. Captain Vere—as before, the central figure among the assembled commissioned officers—stood nigh the break of the poop-deck facing forward. Just Below him on the quarter-deck the marines in full equipment were drawn up much as at the scene of the promulgated sentence.  <pb facs="7fce5afa-d3fc-41f7-80ec-21339d7b1a8e" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17742"/>

</p><p>At sea in the old time, the execution by halter of a military sailor  was generally from the fore-yard. In the present instance, for special reasons the main-yard was assigned. Under weather or lee an arm of that yard the prisoner was presently brought up, the Chaplain attending him. It was noted at the time and remarked upon afterwards, that in this final scene the good man evinced little or nothing of the perfunctory. Brief speech indeed he had with the condemned one,<pb facs="5432d5d6-001c-4323-8300-2720642b8bb4" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17744"/>but the genuine Gospel was less on his tongue than in his aspect and manner towards him. The final preperations personal to the latter being speedily brought to an end by two boatswain&apos;s-mates, the consummation impended. Billy stood facing aft. At the penultimate moment, his words, his only ones, words wholly unobstructed in the utterance were these—&quot;God bless Captain Vere!&quot; Syllables So unanticipated coming from one with the ignominious hemp about his neck—a a conventional felon&apos;s benediction directed towards the quarters of honor; syllables too delivered in the clear melody of a singing-bird <pb facs="61beca86-f30e-4666-84e5-fe39967ec503" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17746"/>on the point of launching from the twig, had a phenomenal effect, not unenhanced by the rare personal beauty of the young sailor spiritualized now thro&apos; late experiences so poignantly profound.   

</p><p>Without volition as it were, as if indeed the ship&apos;s populace were but the vehicles of some vocal current electric, with one voice from alow and aloft came a resonant sympathetic echo–&quot;God bless Captain Vere!&quot; And yet at that instant Billy alone must have been in their hearts, even as he in their eyes. 

</p><p>At the pronounced words and the spontaneous echo that voluminously rebounded them, <pb facs="ede9cf06-eae4-4497-86fb-c7a1caa75b1e" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17748"/>Captain Vere, either thro stoic self-control or a sort of momentary paralysis induced by emotional shock, stood erectly rigid as a musket in the ship-armorer&apos;s rack. 

</p><p>The hull deliberatly recovering from the periodic roll to leeward was just regaining an even keel, when the last fatal death-signal a preconcerted dumb one was given. At the same moment it chanced that the vapory fleece hanging low in the East, was shot thro with a soft glory as of the fleece of the Lamb of God seen in mystical vision <pb facs="ee4b1f65-453f-4a05-b6d3-b4edd7048da1" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;17750"/>and Simultaniously therewith, watched by the wedged mass of upturned  faces, Billy ascended; and, ascending, took the full rose of the dawn.  

</p><p>In the pinioned figure, arrived at the yard-end, to the wonder of all no motion was apparent none–save that created by the ship&apos;s motion, in moderate weather so majestic in a great ship ponderously-cannoned.</p></body>
