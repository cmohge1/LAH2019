Of a series of incidents within a brief term rapidly following each other, the adequate   <pb facs="506ad4cc-cc1c-4736-b5d7-46373529e675" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;18548"/>narration may take up a term less brief, especially if explanation or comment here and there seem requisite to the better understanding   <pb facs="dc9d239a-fd68-43e7-b8ce-1ed2dde214fb" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;18559"/>of such incidents. Between the entrance into the cabin of him who never left it alive, and him who when he did leave it left it as one condemned to die; between <pb facs="bb6da677-dd34-4cab-8832-2a948e42ae84" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16826"/>this and the closeted interview just given less than an hour and a half  had elapsed. It was an interval long enough however to awaken speculations among no few of the ship&apos;s company as to what it was that could be detaining in the cabin the master-at-arms and the sailor; for a rumor that both of them had been seen to enter it and neither of them had been seen to emerge, this rumor had got abroad upon the gun-decks and in the tops; the people of a great war ship being in one respect like villagers, taking microscopic note of every outward movement or non-movement going on. When therefore in weather <pb facs="22733a6e-3471-489d-bbd8-e8a8bfdf91be" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16497"/>not at all tempestuous all hands were called in the second dog-watch, a summons under such circumstances not usual in those hours, the crew were not wholly unprepared for some announcement extraordinary, one  having connection too with the continued absence of the two men from their wonted haunts.  

</p><p>There was a moderate sea at the time; and the moon, newly risen and near to being at its full, silvered the white spar-deck wherever not blotted by the clear-cut shadows horizontally thrown of fixtures and moving men. On either side the quarter-deck the massive <pb facs="af1f5027-261a-49df-bfc0-5f476e390c62" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16830"/>guard under arms was drawn up; and Captain Vere standing in his place surrounded by all the ward-room officers, addressed his men. In so doing his manner showed neither more nor less than that properly pertaining to his supreme position aboard his own ship. the. In clear terms and concise he told them what had taken place in the cabin; that the master-at-arms was dead; that he who had killed him had been already tried by a summary court and condemned to death; and that the execution would take place in the early morning watch. <pb facs="f2ccada0-bc5f-4bbe-9743-5a0798712420" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;16499"/>The word <hi rend="italic">mutiny</hi> was not named in what he said. He refrained too from making the occasion an opportunity for any preachment as to the maintenance of discipline, thinking perhaps that under existing circumstances in the navy the consequence of violating discipline should be made to speak, for itself.  

</p><p>Their captain&apos;s announcement was listened to by the throng of standing sailors in a dumbness like that of a seated congregation of believers in hell listening to the clergyman&apos;s announcement of his Calvinistic text. <pb facs="98dd6d56-f618-4a64-8264-b2478696d467" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;18552"/>

</p><p>At the close, however, a confused murmer went up. It began to wax. All but instantly, then, at a sign, it was pierced and suppressed by shrill whistles of the Boatswain and his mates piping down one watch.  

</p><p>To be prepared for burial Claggart&apos;s body was delivered to certain petty-officers of his mess. And here, not to clog the sequel with lateral matters, it may be added that at a suitable hour, the Master-at-Arms was committed to the sea with every funeral honor properly belonging to his naval grade. <pb facs="1a7bc6ee-e0c7-430f-b2f2-99ec797266c2" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;18608"/>

</p><p>In this proceeding as in every public one growing out of the tragedy  strict adherence to usage was observed. Nor in any point could it have been at all deviated from either with respect to Claggart or Billy Budd without begetting undesirable speculations in the ship&apos;s company, sailors, and more particularly men-of-war&apos;s men, being of all men the  greatest sticklers for usage. For similar cause, all communication  between Captain Vere and the condemned one closed ended with the closeted interview already given, the latter being now surrendered to the <pb facs="b62618ac-f339-4117-a7de-a0f97b778088" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;18610"/>ordinary routine preliminary to the end. His transfer under guard from the Captain&apos;s quarters was effected without usual precautions—at least no visible ones.— , If possible not to let the men so much as surmise that their officers anticipate aught amiss from them is the tacit rule in a military ship. And the more that some sort of trouble should really be apprehended the more do the officers keep that apprehension to themselves; tho&apos; not the less unostentatious vigilance may be augmented.  <pb facs="beaf5aa8-888d-4470-ae31-b698d72cdab1" tl_leaf="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.textlab.org&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;18612"/>In the present instance the sentry placed over the prisoner had strict orders to let no one have communication with him but the Chaplain. And certain unobtrusive measures were taken absolutely to insure this point.</p></body>
